## Finding Sources

### 1. Choose the right database(s) for your project.

* [JumboSearch, Tufts catalog, or libraries worldwide?](https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/)
* [MLA International Bibliography](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=PQMLA)
* [African American Newspapers 1827-1998](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=RDXAfAmNews)

### 2. Combine keywords and subject terms in your searches.

Keywords are important words from your topic which you use to search a database. Usually a keyword search will search an item's title, author, subject, table of contents, or full text.  

Subject terms are **controlled vocabularies** assigned to items by librarians. Subject searches may return fewer items, but the results are usually more relevant.

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.

#### Select subject terms

* [ Discrimination in law enforcement -- United States](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?query=sub,exact,%20Discrimination%20in%20law%20enforcement%20--%20United%20States,AND&tab=everything&search_scope=EVERYTHING&sortby=date&vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0)
* [Slavery -- United States -- Psychological aspects](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?query=sub,exact,%20Slavery%20--%20United%20States%20--%20Psychological%20aspects,AND&tab=everything&search_scope=EVERYTHING&sortby=date&vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0)

### 3. Consult Reference sources.

Reference sources (bibliographies, encyclopedias, and handbooks) provide helpful summaries, background information, and bibliographies on your topic.

[Oxford Bibliographies Online](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)

### 4. Use Google, but use it wisely.

Using Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous sources.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.

### 5. Ask a librarian

## A Primer on Primary Sources and Archives

**Primary sources** are original documents used by scholars to reconstruct a historical event, provide an interpretation of a text, or engage in other intellectual activity.

* Manuscripts
* Critical editions
* Newspapers
* Correspondence
* Websites
* Photographs
* Social media posts
* Song lyrics

**Secondary sources** are the scholarly conversations about a historical event, a literary work, a topic, or some other item of intellectual interest.

* Journal articles
* Monographs
* Essays
* Podcasts

The difference between primary sources and secondary sources is not absolute.

But the distinction is important.
* Primary sources should form the basis of your research.
* Secondary sources should be used as conversation partners about primary sources.

Primary sources are usually collected and stored in archives (physical or digital) and are discoverable through databases (physical or digital).

### Subject terms for finding primary sources in Tufts Catalog

* Diaries
* Facsimiles

### An Ethical Observation

* Clich√©: "History is written by the victors."

Archives of various kinds form the foundation of historical reconstruction.

What materials are  archived?  
Why are *these* materials archived?  
Who is archiving materials?  
Whose voices and perspectives are archived?  
Who gets access to archives?

Sometimes, marginalized voices can be discovered even in the archives of the victors. Or perhaps they can be "critically fabulated."

By engaging in archival research, you have the opportunity to give breath to those whose breath has been taken from them.
